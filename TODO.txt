to date the only census product i was consider was the equal employment opportunity survey
the ahs survey includes information like 'bars on windows'.

this is not common in suburbs, but is still common in violent and crime ridden ghettos around the east coast.
therefore this could be used as an indicator of a dangerous area since crime statistics dont really seem to hold up.

aside from the fact that delaware is full of violent *****s lol
