I find it interesting one of their favorite phrases in movies and tv is they dont need us.
what does that mean ?
what kind of fucked up brainwashing shit do they go through as children ?

as it turns out at least i can watch the expanse season 5 without zimmermans narration bullshit preventing me from making an honest appraisal 
like season 4

you know.

as i try to rebuild gdal with the proj issues fixed.. i hope..

i wonder.. when does this end ?
why do i have to be around so many sick people ?
why is it that my father hated me so much that he arranged for me to be here at all ?

what kind of bored rich perverted pathetic scum designed the methods they use to make these people as they are ?

i mean it pains me to think in their mindset trying to understand and spot the cynicism of an older generation male, which btw is pretty apparent
in much of what they do... so i often dont anymore.
thats mainly the issue.

with literally any other mental illness trying to understand is not an excercise in mentally poisoning themselves, but they are REALLY
fucked up.
