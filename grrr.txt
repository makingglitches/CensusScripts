so that be ing said.

here we are again and they make even less sense to me this time.

i just see a bunch of people wasting their lives everywhere and seemingly not even aware they are.

young and old.

its a shame they only want us to give them something else to have them other than money or something sensible.
otherwise this would be more interesting.

as it is abstinence is becoming a way of life
may as well have been a monk.

truly.

i'm not feeding their desire to abuse their desired object of abuse and i dont want to deal with these peoples shit either.

so they can go to hell or stay there, which i would imagine they see this as.

or will in time.

i saw where they end up.
my parents were like them and they were bitter and alone in the end.
