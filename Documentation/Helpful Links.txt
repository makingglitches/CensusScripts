obviously some miners would be very helpful.
plants and species arent always so easily obtained


the kml database from the national parks service databases which redirects to arcgis contains more usuable features if you can
find the actual datasource you're looking for.

something to look at 

https://mapbox.github.io/togeojson/
https://geojson.org

its possible that I may want to consider from the perspective of someone who is walking around a lot... maybe..
adding a time buffer to incorporate extra rest and recuperation between each major point.

i wonder if they realize when i talk about separatist things I mean forming a place where we can raise children and adults who arent raped ? they must underestimate how infectious they are.

I may have to go to each state governments websites to compile better data


-- kind of useless data.
https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/inventory

-- maybe with headwater consideration ?
https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/esri::usa-rivers-and-streams/data

-- worth deeper look
https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov

see as i said this could keep EVERYONE busy. reproducing gis data in overlay of activities for most redundancy.

rivers and streams gis data
https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/esri::usa-rivers-and-streams/data

as I previously found when they were doing this dumb shit expecting me to pull a solution for entrapmemnt out of my ass since thats all these pedophile whores in colorado specialize in to try to freak out their former  victims into forgetting entire time periods until finally their minds ruined when they are older they just start discarding whole time periods like they did when they were children, that garbage zimmerman and i discussed elevation data which is QUITE  data intensive

redownloaded a pdf of the bulk data download link usgs.
wouldnt it be nice if I could just do gis data work and applications for a fucking living ?
I like data gathering and many things are worth expanding and making more machine parseable so useful 
compilations can be generated for humans !

mother fucking fuck fucks :) x2

Oh and use the same damn usgs downloader and convert anything with .img in a zip into a geotiff, because there are no fucking
readers for the format in c#!
https://apps.nationalmap.gov/downloader/#/

the thought that often comes to mind is do they feel like the idiots they are when they get boners over things like peanute butter or sprigs of celery ?

apparently they dont agree :P

and why is their chomo government still trying to bring out the damage my father put in my mind back in 84 or 85 ?

oh cute, they do this all the fucking time freezing application versions, apparently .img file format is still not being handled that well in gdal.

and the hacky goddamn way one has to install it leads me to question as well !

oh whats better is they took over all the fucking doctor and dentist offices in colorado and staffed them with cocksucking pedo whores and find reasons to deny treatment or cause diseases and problems in people. they dont do this based off of people being like them, or not, they just do these things to fuck a person up in the mind.

oh and in the case of teeth they try to hold a person back in their stupid fucked up neverending feedback loop by ensuring they dont get any permanent marks etc

so in repetition of a previous fucking fuck conversation 

https://water.usgs.gov/ogw/aquifer/map.html

I got this fucking fuck there aquifer data source which the same likely robot fucking fuck on the other side of the f-ing world directed me to the same goddamn page which contained, yes useful data but in a repetition of previous conversations with an agent of the goivernment which is likely not the same person because the government is no longer useful and offices of the fbi in dc are infiltrated by fucking child molesters.
