obviously some miners would be very helpful.
plants and species arent always so easily obtained


the kml database from the national parks service databases which redirects to arcgis contains more usuable features if you can
find the actual datasource you're looking for.

something to look at 

https://mapbox.github.io/togeojson/
https://geojson.org

its possible that I may want to consider from the perspective of someone who is walking around a lot... maybe..
adding a time buffer to incorporate extra rest and recuperation between each major point.

i wonder if they realize when i talk about separatist things I mean forming a place where we can raise children and adults who arent raped ? they must underestimate how infectious they are.

I may have to go to each state governments websites to compile better data

-- kind of useless data.
https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/inventory

-- maybe with headwater consideration ?
https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/esri::usa-rivers-and-streams/data

-- worth deeper look
https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov

see as i said this could keep EVERYONE busy. reproducing gis data in overlay of activities for most redundancy.

rivers and streams gis data

here are some fucking fuck fucking aquifer sources which are indicative of porous rock that water moves through and collects in apparently.
nothing like watching people parasde around retards with possible mental problems numerous times making suggestive comments in a horny voice to them pretending to help
them gain a better chance at walking without a goddamn walker. few times now. and thanks to john zimmerman and his chomo bitch whore tori for polluting my mind and fort collins for being what they are which is a giant trash receptacle asking to be set on fire.

 this renders perfectly in qgis and for 19 gb still doesnt quite reach the layer of granularity one would hope for for that kind of data usage.
https://www.mrlc.gov/data?f%5B0%5D=category%3Atree%20canopy

this contains the installer for the qgis desktop application and adjoining libraries compiled for windows like gdal.
