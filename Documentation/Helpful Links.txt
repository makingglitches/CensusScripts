obviously some miners would be very helpful.
plants and species arent always so easily obtained


the kml database from the national parks service databases which redirects to arcgis contains more usuable features if you can
find the actual datasource you're looking for.

something to look at 

https://mapbox.github.io/togeojson/
https://geojson.org

its possible that I may want to consider from the perspective of someone who is walking around a lot... maybe..
adding a time buffer to incorporate extra rest and recuperation between each major point.

i wonder if they realize when i talk about separatist things I mean forming a place where we can raise children and adults who arent raped ? they must underestimate how infectious they are.

I may have to go to each state governments websites to compile better data


-- kind of useless data.
https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/inventory

-- maybe with headwater consideration ?

-- worth deeper look

see as i said this could keep EVERYONE busy. reproducing gis data in overlay of activities for most redundancy.

rivers and streams gis data

as I previously found when they were doing this dumb shit expecting me to pull a solution for entrapmemnt out of my ass since thats all these pedophile whores in colorado specialize in to try to freak out their former  victims into forgetting entire time periods until finally their minds ruined when they are older they just start discarding whole time periods like they did when they were children, that garbage zimmerman and i discussed elevation data which is QUITE  data intensive

redownloaded a pdf of the bulk data download link usgs.
wouldnt it be nice if I could just do gis data work and applications for a fucking living ?
I like data gathering and many things are worth expanding and making more machine parseable so useful 
compilations can be generated for humans !

mother fucking fuck fucks :) x2

Oh and use the same damn usgs downloader and convert anything with .img in a zip into a geotiff, because there are no fucking
readers for the format in c#!

the thought that often comes to mind is do they feel like the idiots they are when they get boners over things like peanute butter or sprigs of celery ?

apparently they dont agree :P

and why is their chomo government still trying to bring out the damage my father put in my mind back in 84 or 85 ?
