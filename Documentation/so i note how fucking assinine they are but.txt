its funny how they say we always have money 
when no we tend not to get everything handed to us for free
even 'free' ha. assfucks.
anyway.

so i was watching the new version of the stand and thinking
wow i saw this before
wow i saw this after i was unaware i'd been here again
and wow harold lauder is far better chosen 
and also that there arent many good adaptations of anything and this is another 1980s of cinema but the stand is turning out 
a little bitter than i expected.

and also how much these fucking people seemed washed out and half dead as a result of what they did to the world
*slow clap*
