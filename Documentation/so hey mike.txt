so mike.. mike mike...

i know i see the real mike on the east coast or the one i knew at least 
but this other one... nah

they have this lovely little trick of trying to inhabit other peoples identities 
like my piece of shit father if i could find him right this moment.. :)
instead i get the double he left behind somewhere or the the person they forward my callk to or who they gave me the incorrect phone number leading too.

mike witmer.
oh john michael witmer.
fucking jackass copy says 'oh i cant help you'......

not that the original was necessarily doing anything but playing me false and taking advantage of forgetfullness perhaps.

weirdos.
