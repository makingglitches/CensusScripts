what can we as ordinary human beings inspect or verify ourselves at any given times ?

as a thing grows more complex the answer is less and less.
we all have competing activities that take up our time and those of us that dont they push the reset button on.

do we know our computers are ONLY communicating with the standard osi model for example ?

do we know that we're not subject to port forwarding, advanced nat, and dns/certificate hijacking based off the isp we connect to ?

no we're not although I'm very certain to some degree most of this is true.

imagine they needed to track where you were and had been.

it wouldnt matter so much if this wasnt the end result, this.. whatever the hell it is they are doing to fool dumbass people into brainwashing themselves and everyone else into repeating the sammmmmee shit over and over and over and relying on traumatized adult versions of child victims to remember to do something different or go somewhere different to at least experience a different kind of weird ass fucked up idiot.
