So previously included a printout of a rather useful page which summarized what I was looking for which was an up to date overlay of places you could get killed so as to plot the safest path.

they tend to WANT people to get killed.

so once more I will note

black bears are very hard to be killed by, you have to do something really really stupid to even get them to attack you or they have to already be kind of pissed off by something, avoidance without fear is the number one way to get away from them.

wolves are a fucking different story and i wish we'd shoot them all
as are poisonous snakes i wish we'd just kill in high numbers.
