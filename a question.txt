thats actually what makes me angry.

i keep quitting smoking.

if they werent making themselves so obvious and visible i'd be fine.
i'd be working out in a gym
i'd be working

instead i have memories of them wrongfully arresting me and preventing me at every turn from caring for myself physically in any sense of the word other than eating and hardly sleeping while here of late.

and of them stealing, breaking, and lifting my property as part of some game of make-believe snatch electronic devices that contain memories and reminders etc without so much as a thought because they need to ruin people until they get murdered,
