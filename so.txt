50 first dates makes me want to kill them.

i didnt have a problem at all until these people dragged me here putting me in a nightmare world where my life felt like it was over, over and over by their design and i saw people die, saw people crippled and remembered seeing people get their faces split in half and being raped here as a fucking child.

and learned that my family is a bunch of pedophile traitors and they've fucked up our whole country well enough they can keep people unaware of the real date and time and everything else and memories get shoved back together in a large bunch all ready to be repressed again by these garbage doing the same shit.

seriously, no problems at all. but this place triggers my childhood problem of not wanting to believe a place where the weather is the same and people all do the same shit over and over and there is no future for anyone and they're all fucking baby raping fucks who steal my writing and everything else over and over again is real.

thats the issue and then they try to freak me out beyond compare and when they dont i just drift away when they return me backwards and steal all things that keeps that part of my mind alive until i wander through this and retrieve all these useless memories of them being scum and find i do some things faster.

and whats worse is they basically keep everyone a prisoner.

i do not belong around kiddy rapers.

they made this weirder and weirder and weirder and told me what these creatures were and made me think doing anything resulted in kids getting abused and raped.


tell me how the fuck am I supposed to deal with that ?

i'm glad i saw so many of them die.
some of them stabbed ritualistically with spears at one point.

yeah they're swell people.
