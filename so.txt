and btw when i see things i made, or keep them throughout i remember but you fucks had kim peters and pieces of mexican shit, steak into my fucking area and steal journals and everything else.

this is a depressing thing and if i simply continued life, yeah i'd remmeber
but i don't want to live with baby raping fucks who interpret literally everything as fucking child abuse and prostitution and the queer fucked up things their fucked up fathers did to them, that just keep sme in a mindset where i'm waiting to forget

and btw knowing you people dont care at all, let me ask,  still feel like you accomplished something, slaves ?

you fucked up people used to bug me about talking about things happening before and defying your attempts to cripple my memory, and keeping records and writing etc.

and now you're all fucked.
and half of you are old and ugly and crippled.

hows that working out ? and how did i taste ?
