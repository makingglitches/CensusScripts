I get this strong feeling the people who wrote and directed channel zero no-end house stole the idea from someone else since most of their films look like the fucked up shit these people fantasize about.

realistically no end house seems to have been written by one of us not one of them depicting these psychologically parasitic pieces of garbage.

ever one of their other films, even chucky, depicts something freakish relating more to gay/chomo shit than the other way around.

channel zero depicts: evil brothers, surreal places filled with wraiths, a happy ending where child sacrificers get killed.

that does not seem like something THEY would right because its closer to the world these fucked up people are creating.
