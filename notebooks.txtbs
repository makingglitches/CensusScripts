they are tempting
jupyter notebooks
but python really isnt the language i need to be working in atm.

certainly would be a more familair paradigm to that of node for some things, but browser automation and simplified json manipulation is mostly
what i use node for.


python does seem nice, its just... well...

sql server... you know.
and .. ado.net is pretty well supported
and.. well.. c# is pretty and visual studio is nice..

and pycharm isnt bad but c++, python, r, etc are ugly.
