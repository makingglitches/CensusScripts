wonder if the chicago pd and fort collins pd etc ever found the external hard drives filled with my photographs and works from over the years that they stole and apparently retook and reproduced not giving a damn the additional psychological damage they caused while engineering my descent back into temporary amnesia as i buried more trauma.

ever find the fucking drives you people stole ?

like 5 or 6 times now ?
maybe  more ?

and no making some chomo who should be in prison or dead reproduce things is not sufficient assholes.
since i know you fucking people are just letting them offend again.
