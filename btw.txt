so all this dumb crap they use to categorize their garbage selves
and what they're doing
and what they're trading and whatever else is fucking wrong with them does not apply to us.

i dont need to be jailed to feel ok
i dont need to see people who dont deserve hurt, to be hurt.
unlike these people whom their 'rulers' say are constantly feeling deprived of well anything.

they need to feel like shit.
they need to make other people feel like shit.
or they supposedly go nutty or get more aggressive or whatnot.

one would say 'why dont they just get laid or join a sports team or something like that'

of course they tend to deny all of this if directly confronted and then they turn around keep doing these things and reacting to strange environmental markers their creepy little code which probably just classified them for rich perverts at one point creating a kind of larping game beginning likely somewhere around the late 1800s when slavery was abolished.
