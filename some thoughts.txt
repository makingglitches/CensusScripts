I'm not motivated the same, i like being challenged in an environment that is rational.

example.

soft dev takes money.
it takes time.
it takes fixed expectations.

i can tell you that failure or revision creates wisdom.

example: DONT JAM A 1000 ICONS MEANT TO BE HOVER OVER INFO ON A CALENDAR VIEW !
display real estate severely limits this.
maybe as an indicator something is there, or a job count or something
but a week by week or day by day view is going to be most informative.

and of course it depends on the application.

what i ended up creating was something akin to the days inn software for one screen, and yeah... works at days inn, (this was later), doesmnt work for dispatching :P 

course they WANTED this.
they asked for this.

and yeah we did switch between views.

but yeah.. not the best way.

maybe someone needs to click a litttle goddamn more like they'd turn the pages of a notebook eh ?

or maybe we should have integrated in a physical aspect of the workflow.

this 0 paper bullshit annoys me, it removes physical records of things and this fucked up chomo whore society they're trying to push is like that moron lennon singing about 'imagine no possesions'... tell me why is that ideal ?

he did too much fucking acid
and his fans were likely these dumb cunts !

i like journals, and photos and photo albums that are PRINTS and books and tools and decorations and ornaments. fuck them !
